### üèóÔ∏è Preparation

Make sure that you ...

1. have an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
2. have access to a **Hobby Dyno**, because **"always-on" is required for this use case.**
3. have `.env` file from [these steps](setup-preparation.md) and a [database](../advanced-guides/use-mongodb-atlas.md)


### üßö Heroku is just a click away

Click here:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot)

1. Give your application a fancy name and choose your region
2. Give it a name and fill all _empty_ environment variables with the values of your `.env` file.
3. Make sure that the `MONGO_HOST` value end on &ssl=true 
4. Click _Deploy App_ and see the magic happen üîÆ‚ú®


### ‚úÖ Yeah! 

You have successfully deployed your own notification service to Heroku! Within the [logs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#log-retrieval-via-the-web-dashboard) you can find the registration token and url to access the admin panel.

Make sure to convert your maybe free dyno to a hobby dyno with `always-on` enabled.
