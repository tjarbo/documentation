### ‚úÖ Yeah! 

You have successfully deployed your own fmdb to heroku! Within the *build log* you can find the url to access the admin panel.

:::note
When the notification service freshly starts, the discord cache will be empty. Maybe as a spam bot protection, the bot is only able to send messages to users it already knows. Send the bot a small "test" message to add your admin (discord) account to bots cache.
